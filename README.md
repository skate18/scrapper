Web Scrapper using Symfony 6

Setting up Docker
---------------
Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed on your local machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Docker website: 

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.

Running the Application
---------------
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Execute the following command:
```
docker-compose up

This command will start the Docker containers and set up the necessary dependencies.
